Incorporate LP for accepted contracts, adaptive clustering via inertia elbow, and strict margins on IR and IC constraints.
Refine clustering by weighting duplicates; tighten IR/IC margins adaptively; add post-check cost adjustments; ensure cluster non-emptiness.
Incorporate IR margin, normalize probabilities, enforce strict IC margins, and adaptively cluster for robust action inference.
Use exact equality in LP constraints; apply adaptive KMeans with inertia elbow; enforce stricter IC margins; avoid iterative LP refinements.
Use exact equality constraints for p; apply KMeans with elbow heuristic; enforce strict IR/IC margins; refine costs post-clustering.
Use adaptive clustering from 1 cluster; enforce IC via max rejected utilities; tighten thresholds; avoid LP complexity.
Use adaptive clustering with relaxed thresholds; normalize centers carefully; enforce tighter IC constraints with smaller eps; ensure non-negativity.
Use adaptive clustering on accepted contracts, enforce IR/IC via LP with margins, and refine cost initialization.
Use adaptive clustering with flexible thresholds; incorporate rejected contracts' IC constraints directly; ensure cost margins scale with utilities.
Use adaptive clustering (e.g., weighted KMeans with elbow method) and allow slack in LP constraints for feasibility.
