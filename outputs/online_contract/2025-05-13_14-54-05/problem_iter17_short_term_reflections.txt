Incorporate strict IR/IC margin adjustments and robust clustering with weighted KMeans for diverse, feasible agent actions.
Use weighted clustering with replicated samples for better action representation; enforce strict IR/IC via cost margin adjustments.
Use stricter IR/IC margins, normalize clusters, avoid weighted KMeans, and refine cost adjustments for robust agent settings.
Focus clustering on accepted contracts only; enforce stricter IR/IC margins; remove empty clusters early; avoid weighting rejected points.
Use weighted clustering on accepted data only; remove empty clusters early; enforce IR and IC strictly with margins.
Emphasize weighted clustering, avoid rejected clustering, simplify IC cost bounds, and robustly remove empty clusters.
Incorporate weighted clustering with sample weights; tighten IR/IC margins; ensure cost feasibility; normalize probabilities strictly.
Robustly remove empty clusters, tighten IR/IC margins, and adjust costs post-clustering for strict feasibility and improved fit.
Use raw candidate_ps for clustering; avoid weight replication. Tighten IR/IC margins. Normalize probabilities last.
Use unweighted clustering for clearer action separation; apply stricter margins on IR/IC constraints; normalize probabilities last.
