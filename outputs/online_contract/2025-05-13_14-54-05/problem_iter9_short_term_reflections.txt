Use LP to fit outcome distributions per accepted contract; cluster these for actions; enforce IR/IC via cost bounds.
Use adaptive clustering on raw contracts; enforce stricter IC margins; normalize probabilities post cost adjustment; prefer agglomerative clustering.
Use tighter IC constraints, Euclidean clustering, and multi-action IC inequalities to refine costs and improve agent model.
Cluster on outcome distributions, not payments; enforce stricter IR/IC margins; adaptively select actions via utility consistency.
Use adaptive clustering with tight radius thresholds and explicitly enforce IR and IC constraints via cost adjustments.
Use LP for IC constraints; cluster on outcome distributions, not contracts; enforce strict rejection margins; normalize probabilities carefully.
Use adaptive clustering with tighter radius thresholds and prioritize cost feasibility under IR and IC constraints.
Use adaptive clustering (DBSCAN), iterative cost refinement, and reject strict LP for robust IR and IC satisfaction.
Incorporate rejected logs in cost updates; adapt cluster count from 1; normalize centers robustly; enforce strict IC constraints.
Use weighted clustering with principal rewards; enforce full IR, IC, rejection constraints via LP; normalize probabilities robustly.
