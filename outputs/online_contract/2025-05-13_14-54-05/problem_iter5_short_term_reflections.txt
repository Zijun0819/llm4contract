Incorporate rejection constraints early, cluster candidate distributions, iteratively refine costs ensuring IR and IC satisfaction.
Cluster on feasible outcome distributions matching utilities; enforce strict IR/IC via cost margins; normalize probabilities after clustering.
Use tighter clustering with outcome-weighted distances, enforce full IR and IC LP constraints jointly, and refine costs globally.
Use outcome distributions independent of contracts; apply robust clustering with inertia elbow; tighten cost margins for rejections.
Incorporate stricter IC enforcement, handle noise via nearest cluster assignment, and add margin in cost for rejection consistency.
Cluster contracts by shape, enforce IR/IC strictly, normalize distributions properly, and adaptively select action counts.
Cluster contracts by normalized direction, assign accepted logs via cosine similarity, then solve LP for costs enforcing IR and IC.
Cluster on inferred outcome distributions from LP feasibility; iteratively adjust costs enforcing IR and IC constraints strictly.
Cluster contracts, not distributions; adapt eps in DBSCAN; minimize L1 deviation for p; separate IR and IC cost bounds.
Cluster by contracts, enforce IR/IC via LP, use rejection constraints strictly, minimize costs, normalize probabilities carefully.
