Cluster on inferred outcome distributions, not contracts; refine costs iteratively; enforce strict IR/IC; normalize probabilities carefully.
Use tighter clustering with outcome-weighted distances; jointly optimize probabilities and costs via LP for IR and IC; handle noise adaptively.
Use L1 normalization and elbow method for clustering; enforce strict IR/IC bounds with adaptive cost intervals.
Use LP for IR/IC constraints; cluster accepted contracts by payment patterns; assign costs minimizing sum; normalize probabilities strictly.
Incorporate LP for IC constraints on costs; cluster on agent utilities, not contracts; tighten rejection constraints with margin.
Cluster contracts by outcome distributions, enforce strict IC margins, normalize probabilities, adapt action count via cluster radius.
Use adaptive density clustering, minimize L1 deviation for p, enforce strict IR/IC bounds, assign noise points wisely.
Use LP to fit outcome distributions per accepted contract; cluster these for actions; enforce strict IC with adaptive cost margins.
Focus on LP feasibility for p, cluster on distributions, enforce strict IR/IC, and refine cost with rejected contracts.
Normalize contracts by sum before clustering; use k-distance elbow for eps; assign costs via min IR and max IC bounds.
