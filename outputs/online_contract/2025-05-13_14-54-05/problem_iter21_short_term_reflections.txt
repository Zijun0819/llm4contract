Use tighter IR margins, larger IC margins, and adaptive clustering for robust agent action inference.
Use tighter numerical margins, cluster with refined elbow detection, and adjust costs iteratively for strict IR and IC satisfaction.
Cluster candidate distributions carefully; enforce stricter IR/IC margins; normalize probabilities pre/post cost calculation; remove empty clusters early.
Normalize contracts before LP; tighten IR/IC margins; adapt clustering with elbow method; ensure numeric stability in probabilities.
Normalize probabilities before cost calculation; tighten IR/IC margins; robustly remove empty clusters; refine cost updates for strict constraints.
Use stricter margins, smaller tolerances, robust empty cluster removal, and precise cost adjustments for IR and IC constraints.
Use smaller IR/IC margins, robust empty cluster removal, and precise cost upper bounds for tighter, valid agent settings.
Normalize contracts before clustering; tighten IR/IC margins; ensure stable cluster removal; normalize probabilities pre/post cost calculation.
Normalize contracts before clustering; enforce stricter IR/IC margins; refine cluster count via inertia ratio; re-normalize distributions.
Normalize candidate distributions before clustering; enforce stricter IR/IC margins; re-normalize probabilities after adjustments.
