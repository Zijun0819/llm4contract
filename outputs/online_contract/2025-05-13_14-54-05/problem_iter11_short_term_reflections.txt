Cluster on contracts, not inferred distributions; enforce strict IC margins; normalize probabilities post-clustering; assign accepted contracts precisely.
Use stricter epsilon margins, normalize probabilities carefully, adapt clustering threshold, and enforce IC constraints via max rejected utilities.
Use v (not v - w) in LP; cluster with KMeans and inertia; tighten cost bounds with small margin; normalize probabilities carefully.
Cluster contracts by outcome distributions, enforce full IR and IC via LP, refine costs with strict margins, normalize probabilities.
Increase clustering threshold slightly; refine cost margins for IC; normalize probabilities robustly; handle empty clusters carefully; ensure strict inequalities.
Use LP for costs with IR, IC, rejection; cluster contracts by payment vectors; weight distances by sqrt rewards; enforce strict rejection margins.
Use adaptive KMeans clustering with inertia elbow for actions; enforce strict IC margins; weight clustering by principal utility.
Use joint LP for costs enforcing IR, IC, rejection; cluster outcome distributions via KMeans with elbow method; normalize probabilities.
Relax LP constraints, weight clustering by utility, refine costs via LP enforcing IR and IC with margins.
Use cosine distance clustering, weight by frequency, assign accepted contracts precisely, and enforce strict IR/IC cost margins.
