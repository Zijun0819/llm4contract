Use per-contract LP to infer p; weighted clustering for actions; enforce IR/IC via direct cost bounds; adjust costs for strictness.
Incorporate explicit IC constraints during clustering; refine cost margins; use robust outlier handling; optimize cluster count adaptively.
Use exact equality in LP; robust cluster empty removal; weighted KMeans via replication; strict IR/IC margin adjustments.
Incorporate LP-based p inference, adaptive clustering via KMeans elbow, and tighter IR/IC margins for robust agent settings.
Use unweighted clustering and refine costs only after stable cluster assignments for consistent IR and IC satisfaction.
Incorporate rejected logs clustering; tighten IR/IC margins; consider cost variability; use weighted clustering; normalize probabilities robustly.
Incorporate rejected logs in clustering; tighten IR/IC margins; refine cost adjustments; validate with agent utility consistency.
Refine clusters by removing empties; enforce strict IR/IC margins; adjust costs post-check; normalize probabilities carefully.
Incorporate LP for precise outcome inference, weighted clustering for representative actions, and strict IR/IC margin enforcement.
Use unweighted clustering for clearer action separation; enforce stricter IR/IC margins; normalize probabilities before cost computation.
