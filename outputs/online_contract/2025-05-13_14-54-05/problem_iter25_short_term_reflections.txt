Normalize candidate_ps before clustering; use tighter IR/IC margins; limit iterative adjustments; robust empty cluster removal; stable cost calculations.
Use tighter IR/IC margins, avoid iterative loops, refine clustering elbow detection, and normalize probabilities consistently.
Normalize contracts by centering and scaling before clustering; apply iterative strictness adjustments for IR and IC constraints.
Use tighter numeric margins, robust normalization, adaptive cost updates, and refined clustering for stable, feasible agent inference.
