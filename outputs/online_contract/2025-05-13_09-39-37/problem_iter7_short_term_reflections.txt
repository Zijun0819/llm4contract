Use hierarchical clustering for stability; iteratively adjust costs ensuring IR and IC without over-penalizing; prioritize accepted logs.
Use cosine metric for clustering; assign noise by similarity; iteratively refine costs ensuring all IR and IC constraints.
Use hierarchical clustering for stable action groups; ensure strict IC by cost margin; iteratively refine costs for IR/IC.
Incorporate rejected logs in clustering; use adaptive clustering (DBSCAN); iteratively adjust costs for IR and IC satisfaction.
Use cosine metric for clustering; assign noise by similarity; refine costs iteratively ensuring IR and IC constraints.
Incorporate agent utility constraints for rejected logs; use Euclidean metric clustering; iteratively adjust costs for IR and IC satisfaction.
Incorporate rejected logs' IR constraints, use Euclidean metric for clustering, and iteratively balance costs for IR and IC compliance.
Use adaptive clustering (e.g., DBSCAN), separate accept/reject LPs, refine costs iteratively with margin enforcement.
Use agent utility constraints for rejects; prefer Euclidean clustering; refine costs iteratively with smaller steps; ensure probability normalization.
Use hierarchical clustering; iteratively adjust costs for IR and IC; avoid rejected log proxy distributions; ensure cost monotonicity.
