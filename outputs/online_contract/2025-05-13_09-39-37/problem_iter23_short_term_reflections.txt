Use balanced clustering (min_samples=3), adaptive cost increments, robust LP tolerances, and strict normalization for improved IR/IC satisfaction.
Use min_samples=1 in DBSCAN, finer eps range, smaller cost increments, and more iterations for smoother, accurate cost refinement.
Use balanced clustering (min_samples=3), tighter LP tolerances, adaptive cost increments, and robust noise assignment for improved inference.
Use finer clustering eps grid, stricter cost initialization, and tighter convergence criteria for improved IR and IC satisfaction.
Use tighter LP tolerances, finer clustering eps, robust noise assignment, adaptive cost increments, and strict probability normalization.
Use finer clustering eps and min_samples; tighten LP tolerances; robust tie-breaking for noise; adaptive cost increments; early stopping.
Use smaller min_samples in clustering, finer eps range, smoother cost increments, and stricter normalization for stability.
