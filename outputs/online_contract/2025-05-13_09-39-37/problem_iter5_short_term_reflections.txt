Use rejection LP with utility <0 constraint; cluster with Euclidean metric; iteratively adjust costs for IR and IC violations.
Incorporate rejected logs in clustering; use robust metrics (cosine); enforce strict IR/IC with adaptive cost adjustments.
Incorporate rejected logs in clustering; use adaptive clustering (DBSCAN); iteratively adjust costs ensuring IR and IC constraints.
Incorporate rejected logs in clustering, use cosine distance, adaptive eps, and iterative cost refinement for robust agent inference.
Use adaptive clustering with silhouette scores; enforce IR/IC via iterative cost adjustments; prefer KMeans over DBSCAN for stability.
Cluster all logs jointly; enforce strict IR/IC via iterative cost updates; prefer hierarchical clustering over DBSCAN; validate and adjust costs.
Cluster p's before cost inference; set costs max(accepted utilities, rejected utilities + Îµ); validate and adjust iteratively.
Cluster only accepted logs' p's; separate rejects via cost constraints; refine costs with targeted IR/IC violations.
Incorporate rejected logs into clustering; adapt costs iteratively balancing IR and IC constraints for better fit.
Incorporate rejected logs in clustering, tune DBSCAN eps via silhouette, iteratively adjust costs for IR and IC satisfaction.
