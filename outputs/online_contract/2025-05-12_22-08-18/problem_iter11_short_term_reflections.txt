Use precise probability normalization, robust clustering with weighted averages, add minimal explaining actions individually, and enforce stricter IR/IC constraints with LP refinement.
Use per-contract dummy actions instead of clustering; enforce rejection constraints with tighter margins; refine costs via LP focusing on rejection constraints only.
Use adaptive clustering with weighted centroids, add minimal dummy actions, enforce strict global IR/IC via LP, and iteratively refine costs for better consistency.
Use global LP for IC/IR enforcement, add dummy actions matching unexplained contracts, weight clusters by utilities, normalize precisely, and refine costs iteratively.
Incorporate LP-based global IR/IC enforcement, minimal dummy actions for unexplained contracts, adaptive clustering, weighted centroids, and strict rejection cost margins for improved inference.
Use tighter IR/IC LP constraints, weight clustering by principal utility variance, iteratively add dummy actions, and normalize probabilities post-refinement.
Add iterative IC enforcement after dummy action addition; cluster unexplained accepts; refine costs via LP and ensure strict rejection margins; normalize probabilities consistently.
Emphasize weighted clustering on high-utility contracts, enforce strict rejection margins, dynamically add actions for unexplained contracts, and normalize probabilities precisely.
Use tighter rejection margins, add actions for unexplained acceptances, robustly normalize probabilities, and weight clusters by principal utility for better agent inference.
Use weighted clustering emphasizing high-utility accepted contracts, add dummy actions for unexplained acceptances, and strictly enforce rejection cost margins for robust IR/IC satisfaction.
