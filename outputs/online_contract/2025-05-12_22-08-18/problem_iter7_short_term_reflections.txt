Use adaptive clustering with LP for costs, enforce IC/IR globally, minimize costs for parsimony, and fallback to empirical distributions when infeasible.
Use LP to infer p, enforce strict IR/IC constraints via combined inequalities, adaptively reduce clusters, and refine costs by rejection slack for robustness.
Use weighted clustering to capture contract quality; enforce rejection costs strictly above max rejected utilities; add actions only when unexplained; normalize robustly.
Use adaptive clustering with weighted centroids, iteratively refine costs respecting IR/IC/rejection, add dummy actions for outliers, and ensure probability normalization.
Leverage LP to jointly infer cost and p, enforce strict IR/IC constraints, adapt clusters by data size, and fallback to empirical outcome distributions if infeasible.
Use weighted averaging with principal utilities, adaptive clustering, and add unexplained accepted contracts as new actions to improve agent setting inference.
Use weighted clustering emphasizing better contracts; tighten cost bounds via min accepted utility and max rejected utility; add actions only if unexplained; ensure numerical stability.
Cluster with outcome-normalized contracts; weigh by principal utility; enforce costs via max utilities on accepted/rejected; add precise actions for unexplained acceptances.
Incorporate iterative clustering stability checks, enforce stricter IR/IC margins, add dummy actions for outliers, and iteratively refine costs for robust rejection handling.
Use adaptive clustering with weighted averages, tighten cost bounds via exact IR checks, ensure rejection margins, and add minimal dummy actions for unexplained contracts.
