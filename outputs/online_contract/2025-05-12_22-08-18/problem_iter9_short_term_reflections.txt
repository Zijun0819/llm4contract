Use LP for global IR/IC enforcement, weighted clustering centroids, dummy actions for unexplained acceptances, iterative cost tightening, and precise probability normalization.
Use LP to globally enforce IR/IC, add dummy actions matching unexplained contracts, refine costs iteratively, and normalize probabilities precisely.
Use weighted clustering with principal utility; add minimal dummy actions; refine costs via LP enforcing strict IR/IC; normalize precisely; prefer average linkage clustering.
Use adaptive clustering with weighted centroids, enforce strict IR/IC via tight cost margins, iteratively add actions for unexplained contracts, normalize probabilities robustly.
Use weighted clustering emphasizing high-utility contracts, dynamically add actions to cover unexplained contracts, and strictly enforce rejection margin on costs.
Use adaptive clustering with utility-weighted centroids, minimal dummy actions clustered by unexplained contracts, and strictly enforce IR, IC, and rejection margins.
Incorporate LP-based global IR & IC enforcement, adaptive clustering, weighted centroids, add unexplained actions, and rigorously adjust costs for rejection margins.
Use stable clustering (average linkage), weight contracts by principal utility, enforce tighter rejection cost bounds, and add unexplained acceptance actions adaptively.
Focus on strict rejection margins, adaptive clustering counts, weighted centroids by principal utility, incremental action addition, and careful probability simplex normalization.
Increase cluster adaptivity, weight accepted contracts by utilities, minimize dummy actions via clustering, and tighten cost bounds enforcing IR, IC, and rejection constraints robustly.
