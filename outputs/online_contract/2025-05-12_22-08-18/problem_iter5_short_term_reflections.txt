Cluster normalized accepted contracts by shape, enforce tighter rejection cost bounds, adaptively add actions explaining outliers, and optimize p maximizing principal value vector.
Use adaptive clustering with weighted averaging, enforce strict rejection cost bounds, add actions for unexplained acceptances, and normalize probabilities robustly.
Prefer deterministic outcome distributions, enforce full IR and IC constraints explicitly, use LP with tight slacks, and adaptively limit action count for stability.
Use adaptive clustering with weighted averages, ensure cost bounds cover all contracts, add actions for unexplained accepts, and enforce strict rejection margins.
Increase cluster adaptivity; separate p and cost inference; enforce strict IR/IC with small epsilon; refine p via LP per cluster center; fallback on empirical distributions.
Cluster contractsâ€™ payment vectors rather than max payouts; solve (p,c) per cluster with LP; enforce IC/IR/rejection iteratively; add dummy actions if needed.
Use convex optimization to tightly fit accepted clusters, enforce IC by adjusting costs, add dummy actions to handle rejections, and normalize distributions precisely.
Use adaptive clustering with utility-weighted averages, enforce stricter rejection margins, add missing actions, and normalize probabilities robustly for consistent agent settings.
Use adaptive clustering, separate p and cost inference, enforce strict IR/IC constraints, and iteratively reduce clusters for feasible, parsimonious agent models.
Use adaptive clustering based on data size, weight by principal utility, enforce strict IR/IC bounds, add missing actions precisely, and refine cost margins for rejection.
