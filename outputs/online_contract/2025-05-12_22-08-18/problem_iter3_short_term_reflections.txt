Cluster by agent utility differences, jointly optimize probabilities and costs via QP, ensure strict IR/IC constraints, adapt action count to data complexity.
Incorporate LP for cost fitting, enforce strict IR/IC constraints, adaptively select clusters, and refine p from cluster centers for robust agent setting inference.
Incorporate precise LP-based outcome inference, cluster representative distributions, assign contracts by max expected utility, and iteratively adjust costs ensuring IR and strict IC constraints.
Use flexible clustering (like DBSCAN) with adaptive action counts; fit p considering principal utility; solve LP for costs enforcing strict IR/IC constraints robustly.
Cluster accepted contractsâ€™ utilities, jointly optimize distributions and costs via convex programs; enforce strict IR, IC, and rejection constraints globally for coherent agent actions.
Cluster inferred outcome distributions, jointly optimize costs enforcing IR, IC, rejection; tighten LP constraints; add slack for strict rejection; normalize probabilities precisely.
Cluster contracts by accepted wages, adaptively tune cluster count, enforce strict IR/IC/rejection linear constraints, and iteratively solve for costs ensuring feasibility.
Cluster contracts by outcomes, jointly optimize probabilities and costs via LP with IR/IC constraints, project to simplex, and minimize total cost for consistent agent settings.
Cluster contracts by acceptance regions, jointly optimize outcome distributions and costs via LP with IR, IC, rejection constraints, and simplex projection for stability.
Cluster on inferred outcome distributions, jointly optimize probabilities and costs via LP for IR/IC, ensure rejected contracts negative utility with slack.
