1. Use tighter slack for IR/IC constraints.  
2. Improve PCA conditions and clustering stability.  
3. Ensure strictly positive costs with adaptive regularization.
1. **Improve clustering stability** by increasing `n_init` in KMeans (e.g., from 20 to 30) for more consistent results.  
2. **Refine action assignment logic** for rejections to better align with utility-based decision-making.  
3. **Tighten slack values** (e.g., `1e-10` instead of `1e-8`) to enforce stricter feasibility and incentive constraints.  
4. **Enhance cost regularization** by using average observed wages to ensure realistic, positive action costs.
1. **Diversify LP solutions** via perturbed objectives for richer candidate probabilities.  
2. **Reduce PCA components** to prevent overfitting in probability clustering.  
3. **Tighter clustering range** and improved elbow detection enhance action inference.  
4. **Strengthen IC constraints** with adaptive slack to improve robustness.  
5. **Regularize costs** using average wages to ensure realistic, positive values.
Use tighter slack, stricter normalization, and improved clustering for better agent setting inference.
1. Use tighter slack and adaptive regularization.  
2. Improve clustering with better initialization.  
3. Normalize probabilities more robustly.  
4. Leverage rejected contracts for tighter IC constraints.
Increase KMeans `n_init` for better clustering stability and use tighter slack for cost computation.
Increase `n_init` in KMeans for better clustering stability and tighter slack for stricter constraints.
1. Use tighter slack and adaptive regularization.  
2. Improve clustering with better PCA and elbow detection.  
3. Ensure strictly positive costs via fallback averaging.
Increase PCA components, use stricter slack, and ensure positive costs for better agent setting inference.
1. **Improve PCA conditions**: Use PCA only when sufficient data points exist (e.g., >3 samples) to ensure stable dimensionality reduction.  
2. **Refine clustering**: Increase `n_init` in KMeans for better cluster initialization and more consistent results.  
3. **Accurate action assignment**: For rejections, assign actions based on utility thresholds to better reflect IC constraints.  
4. **Tighter slack handling**: Use stricter slack values (e.g., 1e-10) for precise cost estimation under IR and IC constraints.  
5. **Cost regularization**: Ensure positive costs for taken actions using average wage-based fallback to avoid zero costs.
