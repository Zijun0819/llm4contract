1. Use more initial clusters (n_candidates=10) for better coverage.  
2. Increase KMeans n_init to 20 for stable clustering.  
3. Simplify cost computation using min(wages) for tighter IR constraints.  
4. Avoid post-hoc cost adjustments; integrate constraints directly.  
5. Maintain numerical stability with small slack (1e-6).
Use elbow method for clustering, ensure non-negative costs, and handle numerical stability with proper slack values.
Use PCA for dimensionality reduction, adaptive clustering with elbow method, and refined cost computation with regularization.
1. Use fixed candidate number for stable clustering.  
2. Normalize probabilities post-clustering.  
3. Compute costs using min/max wages for IR/IC.  
4. Ensure non-negative costs with slack.
Use PCA for dimensionality reduction before clustering to improve agent setting inference.
Use PCA for dimensionality reduction, adaptive clustering with elbow method, and ensure strict positivity of costs for accepted contracts.
Use PCA for better clustering, ensure valid probability normalization, and carefully handle cost constraints.
1. Avoid PCA before clustering; work directly in outcome space for better fidelity.  
2. Use `np.min(wages, axis=1)` for tighter IR constraint estimation.  
3. Simplify cost adjustments; avoid redundant post-hoc corrections.
Use adaptive clustering, ensure IR/IC feasibility, and refine cost estimation with regularization.
1. **Improve PCA dimensionality reduction** by ensuring sufficient components for variance retention.  
2. **Refine clustering** with better initialization and validation metrics.  
3. **Enhance assignment logic** using utility maximization rather than Euclidean distance.  
4. **Strengthen cost inference** with tighter IR and IC constraint handling.  
5. **Add regularization** to ensure robust, generalizable agent strategies.
