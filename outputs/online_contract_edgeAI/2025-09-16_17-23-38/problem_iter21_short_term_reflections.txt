Use stricter slack, refined clustering, and better cost regularization to improve agent setting inference.
Use tighter probability normalization, adaptive clustering, and robust cost estimation with ultra-tight slack for better agent setting inference.
1. **Increase n_init for KMeans** to improve clustering stability.  
2. **Use tighter slack** for cost computation to enforce constraints.  
3. **Regularize with wage-based costs** to ensure positive, meaningful values.  
4. **Normalize probabilities** carefully to maintain valid distributions.  
5. **Assign actions based on utility thresholds** to better reflect agent behavior.
Use tighter slack, better clustering, and ensure positive costs for accepted contracts.
