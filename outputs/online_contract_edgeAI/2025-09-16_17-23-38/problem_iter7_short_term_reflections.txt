1. Use PCA for dimensionality reduction before clustering to improve efficiency and reduce noise.  
2. Map cluster centers back to original space using closest points for better representation.  
3. Compute IR costs using minimum wages across outcomes to ensure tighter constraints.  
4. Set rejected contract costs to a large negative value to handle infeasible cases.  
5. Apply adaptive slack and regularization to ensure valid, positive costs for all actions.
1. **Fix the number of candidate actions** (`n_candidates = 10`) for more stable inference, rather than adaptive clustering which can be unreliable.

2. **Improve cost estimation** by using `min(wages)` for IR constraints to ensure tighter, more realistic cost bounds.

3. **Increase `n_init` in KMeans** to 20 for better initialization and more consistent clustering results.

4. **Simplify cost computation** by removing over-complicated adjustments; ensure non-negativity with a small slack.

5. **Normalize probability distributions** after clustering to maintain validity of outcome probabilities.
1. **Fix probability normalization**: Ensure `p0` rows sum to 1 after clustering and before cost computation.  
2. **Stabilize cost estimation**: Replace `-np.inf` in `c_rej` with a small negative value for numerical robustness.  
3. **Improve clustering**: Use consistent `n_candidates` and avoid dimensionality reduction to preserve information.  
4. **Accurate assignments**: Compute action assignments using expected utilities for all contracts explicitly.  
5. **Enhance LP feasibility**: Normalize LP solutions properly to maintain valid probability distributions.
1. **Avoid PCA** for probability recovery; directly cluster LP solutions for better accuracy.  
2. **Refine cost estimation** using tighter IR/IC constraints and avoid over-regularization.  
3. **Ensure strictly positive costs** for accepted actions to maintain incentive compatibility.
