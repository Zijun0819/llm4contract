Use tighter slack, adaptive clustering, and wage alignment regularization for better agent setting inference.
Use stricter PCA, enhanced clustering, and ultra-tight slack for better agent setting inference.
1. **Stability in PCA**: Ensure sufficient data points for reliable PCA decomposition.  
2. **Elbow Method**: Use stabilized K-means with a proper range for better clustering.  
3. **Probability Normalization**: Apply tight clipping and normalization to maintain valid distributions.  
4. **Assignment Logic**: Align agent actions with utility-based selection for both accept/reject cases.  
5. **Cost Estimation**: Use ultra-tight slack and robust min/max operations for IR and IC constraints.  
6. **Regularization**: Enforce strictly positive costs with fallback averaging when direct computation fails.  
7. **Numerical Safeguards**: Clip and bound all probabilities and costs to avoid invalid values.
1. Use tighter slack (1e-12) for numerical stability.  
2. Normalize probabilities robustly to avoid zero sums.  
3. Apply PCA only when data is sufficient and high-dimensional.  
4. Improve elbow method with second derivative for clustering.  
5. Ensure strictly positive costs via adaptive regularization.
Use tighter slack, enhance PCA stability, and improve cost regularization for better agent setting inference.
1. Use tighter slack for IR/IC constraints.  
2. Normalize probabilities more robustly.  
3. Increase k-means initializations for stability.  
4. Ensure strictly positive costs via regularization.
Use stricter clustering, tighter slacks, and better regularization for more accurate agent setting inference.
1. **Tighter probability normalization**  
2. **Improved clustering with robust elbow method**  
3. **Stricter cost regularization for IR/IC feasibility**  
4. **Enhanced handling of rejections in assignments**  
5. **Ultra-tight slack for numerical stability**
1. **Tighter Slack**: Use ultra-tight slack (e.g., 1e-15) for precise cost estimation.  
2. **PCA Stabilization**: Apply PCA early to reduce noise and improve clustering stability.  
3. **KMeans Initialization**: Increase `n_init` for more stable and accurate clustering.  
4. **Elbow Range**: Start elbow method from `k=2` to better capture data structure.  
5. **Probability Clipping**: Clip probabilities tightly to [0, 1] and normalize accurately.  
6. **Cost Regularization**: Enforce strictly positive costs using average wages where needed.  
7. **Action Assignment**: Assign actions via utility maximization for all contracts consistently.
1. **Tighter Slack**: Use smaller slack values (e.g., `1e-15`) for stricter feasibility.
2. **Improved Clustering**: Increase `n_init` in KMeans for better initialization.
3. **Elbow Range**: Start KMeans range from 2 to avoid degenerate clusters.
4. **Cost Regularization**: Ensure positive costs via wage-based fallbacks.
5. **Probability Normalization**: Clip and renormalize probabilities more carefully.
