1. **Increase max_k** for more candidate actions.  
2. **Use stricter slack** for tighter constraints.  
3. **Improve PCA dimensionality** for better clustering.  
4. **Refine cost regularization** to ensure positivity.
1. Use tighter cost bounds from IR and IC constraints.  
2. Improve clustering for better action representation.  
3. Regularize costs to ensure positivity and feasibility.
Use PCA for dimensionality reduction before clustering to improve agent setting inference.
Use PCA for dimensionality reduction before clustering to improve agent setting inference accuracy.
1. **Improve clustering stability** by increasing `n_init` in KMeans.
2. **Use utility maximization** for better action assignments.
3. **Tighten IR/IC constraints** with min/max wage bounds.
4. **Regularize costs** using average wages for positivity.
Use PCA for dimensionality reduction before clustering to improve agent setting inference.
1. **Increase max_k range** to allow more clusters (15 vs. 10) for better fit.  
2. **Start KMeans range at 2** to avoid degenerate clustering.  
3. **Use utility-based assignments** for all contracts, not just accepted ones.  
4. **Align cost computation** with actual agent incentives and constraints more precisely.
