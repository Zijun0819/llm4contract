Use clustering on accepted contract solutions, ensure IR/IC feasibility, and refine cost estimation for better utility alignment.
1. Use accepted contracts to infer agent preferences via LP.
2. Cluster inferred preferences to reduce action space.
3. Set costs to satisfy IR constraints.
4. Ensure IC constraints via optimal action selection.
1. Use accepted contracts to infer agent preferences via LP.
2. Cluster inferred preferences for representative actions.
3. Set costs to satisfy IR: min wage for accepted actions.
4. Ensure IC: rejected contracts yield lower utility.
5. Optimize clustering and cost bounds for better fit.
Use more precise clustering, better handle rejected contracts, and ensure consistent utility calculations.
Use tighter bounds, improve clustering, and better handle rejected contracts for more accurate agent setting inference.
1. Use tighter cost bounds from IR and IC constraints.  
2. Improve clustering with better distance metrics.  
3. Add regularization to avoid degenerate solutions.  
4. Validate probability distributions more strictly.  
5. Increase robustness with adaptive slack margins.
1. Use accepted contracts to infer agent preferences via LP.
2. Cluster inferred preferences to reduce dimensionality.
3. Assign actions based on utility maximization.
4. Set costs to satisfy IR: minimum wage for accepted actions.
5. Set costs to satisfy IC: maximum wage for rejected actions.
6. Ensure non-negative costs and valid probability distributions.
