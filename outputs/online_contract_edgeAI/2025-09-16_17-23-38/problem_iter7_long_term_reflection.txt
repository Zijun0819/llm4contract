Use PCA for stable dimensionality reduction, apply adaptive clustering with consistent `n_candidates`, and enforce tight IR/IC constraints using minimum wages. Normalize probabilities post-clustering, ensure non-negative costs with adaptive slack, and augment rejected contract constraints for robustness. Leverage LP duality for feasibility and map cluster centers accurately to original space.
