1. **Fix n_candidates**: Use adaptive clustering (elbow method) instead of fixed n_candidates for better fit.
2. **Improve cost estimation**: Incorporate both IR and IC constraints more robustly, ensuring numerical stability.
3. **Refine probability normalization**: Ensure precise probability distribution normalization after clustering.
4. **Enhance PCA mapping**: Accurately map PCA-reduced cluster centers back to original space for better representation.
1. **Fix the number of candidate actions** (e.g., `n_candidates = 10`) instead of using adaptive methods like the elbow method, which can lead to instability.

2. **Avoid PCA when data is insufficient**; directly use candidate probabilities to maintain accuracy and reduce complexity.

3. **Compute costs using minimum wages for IR** and maximum for IC, ensuring tighter bounds and better feasibility.

4. **Increase KMeans `n_init`** (e.g., `n_init=15`) for more stable clustering and consistent results.

5. **Simplify cost regularization**â€”avoid complex adjustments, and directly set non-negative costs based on observed wages.
1. Use fixed candidate number for stability.  
2. Normalize probabilities post-clustering.  
3. Ensure non-negative costs with slack.  
4. Improve clustering with better initialization.
Use adaptive clustering, PCA dimensionality reduction, and tighter cost bounds with regularization for better agent setting inference.
1. Use zero objective in linprog for better feasibility.  
2. Always normalize probabilities.  
3. Handle rejected contract costs carefully.  
4. Ensure non-negative costs.  
5. Cluster all valid candidate solutions.
Use adaptive clustering, normalize probabilities, and ensure positive costs with slack.
1. Use PCA for dimensionality reduction before clustering to improve efficiency and reduce noise in candidate probability distributions.

2. Apply the elbow method more reliably by ensuring sufficient data points and smoothing distortion curves for better cluster number selection.

3. When computing IR and IC constraints, use minimum and maximum expected wages accurately to set tight, realistic cost bounds.

4. Always validate and normalize probability distributions to ensure they sum to one and remain within [0, 1] bounds.

5. Regularize costs by leveraging average wages for assigned contracts, ensuring non-negative and meaningful cost values.

6. Maintain numerical stability by introducing small slack margins and handling edge cases with no assigned contracts.
Use accepted contracts to infer agent outcomes via LP, cluster them for diverse strategies, and set costs ensuring IR/IC constraints.
Use adaptive clustering, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and tighter IR/IC constraint handling with regularization.
1. Use LP duality for tighter feasibility checks.
2. Improve clustering with better initialization.
3. Augment rejected contract constraints for robustness.
