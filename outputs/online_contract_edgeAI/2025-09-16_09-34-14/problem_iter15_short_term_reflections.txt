Optimize GaussianMixture components for better fit.
Optimize with BIC, balance, and regularize.
Use balanced n_candidates to avoid overfitting.
Increase iterations, candidates, and use AIC.
Use BIC instead of AIC.
Balance n_candidates to avoid overfitting.
Optimize with BIC, refine, and regularize.
Balance model complexity using AIC/BIC scores.
Increase candidates and iterations.
Use BIC instead of AIC for model selection.
