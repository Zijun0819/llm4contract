Initialize costs based on accepted contracts, use clustering to identify distinct actions, adjust for rejected contracts with safety margins.
Refine cost bounds and simplify objective; focus on constraint satisfaction, not IC penalties.
Use Bayesian GMM for clustering, tighter cost bounds, and a simpler objective function.
Use tighter constraints for IR and IC, optimize costs with balanced penalties.
Refine cost bounds with tighter IR constraints; use direct GaussianMixture without scaling; simplify penalty objective.
Consider IC constraints more carefully in objective; use GaussianMixture for tighter clustering.
Infer more action distributions; optimize costs to strictly enforce log constraints.
Handle rejection logs by adjusting cost lower bounds to enforce IC constraints with penalties. Use regularization for stability.
Include cost estimation during gradient-based clustering; adjust using rejected contracts with eps.
Cluster only with accepted logs, set lower cost bounds efficiently, ignore upper bounds.
