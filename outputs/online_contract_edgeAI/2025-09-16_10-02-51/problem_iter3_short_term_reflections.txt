Use DBSCAN to cluster, optimize costs via penalty-based IC/IR enforcement.
Use clustering with dynamic size, ensure costs exceed rejected contract utilities, and handle edge cases explicitly.
Use tighter cost bounds and resolve conflicts with averages; optimize probability inference with principal's constraints.
Incorporate clustering adaptively, optimize cost estimates, and handle rejected contracts carefully.
Use Bayesian GMM with adaptive clusters and enforce strong IC via max utilities from rejections.
Estimate costs via optimization to minimize constraint violations, using probabilistic clustering for outcomes.
Use Gaussian Mixture for clustering, adjust costs via rejection logs, and handle zero-acceptance cases robustly.
Use clustering on inferred distributions, adaptively set costs from logs, ensure rejection constraints.
Use adaptive clustering and ensure costs cover all rejection utilities.
Cluster contracts more robustly and refine IR/IC with correct utility constraints.
