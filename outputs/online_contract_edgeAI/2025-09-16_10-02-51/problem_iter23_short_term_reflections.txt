Use tighter cost bounds and refined clustering to better capture agent constraints and preferences.
Refine cost bounds with tighter epsilon, use L-BFGS-B optimization and mean initial guess for robustness.
Focus on tightening cost bounds and refining objective penalties for better constraint satisfaction.
Refine GMM clustering; tighten cost bounds; improve constraint enforcement.
Refine cost bounds carefully; balance constraints for realism and penalize violations more effectively.
1. Enforce stricter feasibility checks on probability vectors.
2. Use smaller epsilon for tighter constraint margins.
3. Optimize cost bounds with explicit constraints in SLSQP.
4. Simplify objective penalty terms to improve convergence.
5. Ensure cost bounds are informed by both accepted and rejected contracts.
Use tighter cost bounds, enforce IC constraints per-log, and refine clustering for better accuracy.
Refine cost bounds with tighter constraints and improved GMM initialization for better consistency.
1. Refine clustering: Use principal utility to weight inferred distributions.
2. Improve cost bounds: Consider action-specific constraints from logs.
3. Optimize for sparsity: Prioritize few actions with distinct cost ranges.
4. Validate IC constraints: Ensure unique best responses per contract.
Refine cost bounds with tighter tolerances; optimize violations with quadratic penalties.
