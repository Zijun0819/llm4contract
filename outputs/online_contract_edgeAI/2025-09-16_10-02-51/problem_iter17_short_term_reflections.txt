Focus on refining cost bounds; ensure IC constraints are precisely enforced to reduce utility violations.
Use explicit IC constraints and trust-constr to ensure consistency.
Focus on tighter IC constraints, prefer trust-constr for constraints, and ensure precise action utilities.
Use tighter cost bounds; optimize IC/IR via minimizing constraint violations.
Use GMM over K-Means for probability clustering; optimize IC and IR with fewer, tighter constraints.
Enforce IC constraints explicitly; use trust-constr for optimization stability.
1. Enforce explicit IC constraints.
2. Use trust-constr for complex constraints.
3. Prioritize penalty for constraint violations.
4. Handle sparse data with random_state in clustering.
5. Simplify bounds using LinearConstraint.
Ensure costs respect both acceptance and rejection logs strictly; use tighter constraints and penalties for violations.
Handle IR and IC constraints strictly; use stronger penalties and SLSQP for faster convergence.
Ensure cost bounds are tight from both accepted and rejected logs; refine optimization with SLSQP and precise penalty conditions.
