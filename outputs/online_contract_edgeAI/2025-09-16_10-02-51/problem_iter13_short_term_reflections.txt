Refine by adding noise tolerance with epsilon, increase candidate actions to 12, and use nonlinear constraints for better cost optimization.
Refine cost boundaries using epsilon slack, adjust penalty weight, and validate optimization success.
Refine initial centroid clustering; optimize penalty weighting; ensure epsilon margin for IR.
Use stricter cost bounds, avoid misleading clustering, and simplify constraint checks.
Use constraints and penalties flexibly; avoid excessive normalization and clipping.
Use tighter cost bounds and remove redundant constraints to improve optimization success.
Use clustering validation, robust constraint handling, and utility-aware cost bounding.
Use tighter cost constraints; refine feasibility checks; optimize penalty weights.
1. Use stricter feasibility checks for probabilities.
2. Limit GaussianMixture components for stability.
3. Replace penalty weights with direct constraints for costs.
4. Normalize centroids to valid probability distributions.
5. Ensure cost constraints are linear, not inequality-based.
Focus on more consistent cost bounds and simplified objective, ensuring fewer constraints and stable cluster initialization.
