Refine cluster centroids, use stricter penalties, and optimize convergence tolerance.
Infer costs from both accepted and rejected logs; use tighter bounds and more robust optimization.
Focus on refining cost bounds and ensuring IC constraints with explicit IR checks. Use SLSQP for constraint handling.
Use covariance_type='diag', adjust initial costs to midpoint, and prefer L-BFGS-B for optimization.
Stick to L-BFGS-B optimization; avoid ad-hoc clustering heuristics.
Squaring penalty errors improves stability. Prefer L-BFGS-B optimizer for efficiency. Initialize costs between bounds.
Focus on refining clustering, incentive constraints, and optimization method for accuracy.
Use tighter cost bounds from both accepted and rejected logs; optimize with L-BFGS-B for faster, more reliable convergence.
Refine cost bounds using all logs, ensure IC constraints explicitly, and validate feasibility before fitting.
1. Use tighter cost bounds from both accepted and rejected logs.  
2. Enforce stricter incentive compatibility during optimization.  
3. Improve GMM convergence with more iterations and full covariance.
