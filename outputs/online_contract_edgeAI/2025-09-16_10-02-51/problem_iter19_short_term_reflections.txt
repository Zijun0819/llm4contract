Refine cost bounds using rejection logs to tighten feasible regions; enforce stricter IC constraints with penalties.
Refine cost bounds from rejected logs; use tighter constraints and smarter penalty scaling.
Use tighter cost bounds and simpler clustering with explicit constraint enforcement.
Use tighter bounds on costs and reduce overfitting via efficient clustering and constraints.
Refine cost bounds, tighten IC constraints, and explicitly ensure IR via constraints.
Refine cost bounds using both accepted and rejected logs; include action-specific feasibility checks.
Improve clustering settings; use tighter cost bounds and more reliable optimization for constraints.
Focus on tight IR and IC constraints, simplify optimization, and ensure accurate cost bounds.
Prefer SLSQP for efficiency; enforce tighter bounds to reduce violation; use diag covariances.
