Use IC constraints for action selection consistency; optimize costs using trust-constr method.
Refine cluster count dynamically; ensure cost bounds tight for strict IC/IR compliance.
Use more precise IC constraints with pairwise comparisons and refine cost bounds with epsilon.
Use tighter cost bounds and refined penalty weights to ensure IC and IR constraints.
Check rejected contracts to tighten cost bounds. Use penalty weights in objective.
Simplify constraints, ensure feasible costs, and minimize IC violations.
Use more initial guesses in GMM clustering, and ensure cost constraints are correctly enforced with inequality.
Use probabilistic clustering, tighten IR/IC constraints, and optimize for minimal violation.
Use better cost bounds and penalty scaling to enforce constraints more strictly.
Use more outcomes per action, refine cost bounds, and add penalty weighting.
