Check constraint satisfaction more strictly, refine cluster count, use precise optimization constraints.
Check convergence and initial guess stability; adjust penalty weights if needed.
Initialize costs at lower bounds; ensure minimal constraint violations with tighter convergence.
Use correct utility constraints: b_eq should include u_p in v, not v - contract. Add epsilon to ensure IR tightness.
Use tighter constraints on costs; simplify objective; validate probabilities strictly.
Add IC constraint penalties; increase optimizer iterations; use stricter tolerances.
Consider clustering distributions, simplify constraints, refine cost optimization via acceptance conditions.
Incentive compatibility constraints are redundant; focus solely on IR for objective function.
Ensure constraints account for small numerical tolerances, avoid redundant actions, and refine penalty weights for objective convergence.
Use linear programming for probability inference, Gaussian Mixture for clustering, and prioritize strict constraint handling with minimal penalties.
