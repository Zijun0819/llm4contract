Improve cost initialization and tighten constraints for better consistency and efficiency.
1. Optimize costs with tighter constraints, not just lower bounds.
2. Use quadratic penalties for IC and IR violations.
3. Initialize costs above lower bounds for faster convergence.
Use robust cost optimization with linear penalties and tighter bounds to ensure IC and IR.
Use `linprog` for linear optimization; refine constraints with SLSQP; avoid over-clustering.
Use linear programming, enforce strict IC/IR via penalty, and refine cost bounds iteratively.
1. Increase max_iter in GMM.
2. Penalize constraint violations more heavily.
3. Adjust cost bounds using rejected logs.
4. Ensure costs are non-negative.
Use GaussianMixture without scaling and fewer IC penalties for efficiency.
Ensure cost bounds include tolerance; use uniform default when no data; weight penalties consistently.
Use constrained optimization to infer probabilities, enforce IR/IC rigorously with penalty minimization.
- Use covariance_type='diag' in GMM for regularization.
- Add small epsilon to cost bounds for stability.
- Always default to uniform probabilities if no fits.
