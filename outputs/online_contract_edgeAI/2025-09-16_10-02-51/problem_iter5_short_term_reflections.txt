Cluster adaptively, regularize costs, penalize violations heavily, enforce hard constraints.
Use Bayesian GMM for clustering and optimize costs with explicit IR/IC constraints.
Use Bayesian GMM with scaled features; optimize costs with IR/IC penalty regularization.
Use BayesianGaussianMixture, refine cost bounds using both accepted and rejected logs, and optimize with tighter initial conditions.
Use gradient ascent for action inference and Bayesian clustering for robustness.
Ensure inferred costs minimize violation of acceptance/rejection constraints via optimization.
Use clustering with costs bounded below by accepted contract utilities to enforce IR and IC.
Use Bayesian clustering; estimate costs via acceptance utilities minus a small epsilon threshold.
Optimize cost assignments using constraints from both accepted and rejected logs.
Use Bayesian clustering for robust centroids, optimize costs with IR/IC constraints via SLSQP.
