Refine costs via optimization to enforce IC/IR constraints; cluster and merge similar probabilities efficiently.
1. Use KDE for smoother probability clusters.
2. Better estimate costs using both accepted and rejected contract utilities.
3. Optimize cluster count based on data size and complexity.
4. Consider agent's utility thresholds more precisely.
Refine action clustering, optimize costs with constraints, and ensure penalties for IC/IR violations.
Try reducing penalty weights, increasing optimization tolerance and iter limits.
Simplify clustering; infer costs using min/max utilities; avoid overfitting with fewer components.
Use weighted clustering for actions, and ensure costs strictly satisfy rejection constraints.
Use kernel density for action weighting and ensure stricter cost initialization from accepted logs.
1. Optimize for penalties on IR/IC violations.
2. Use SLSQP to refine parameters.
3. Assign labels by proximity, not just clustering.
4. Adjust constraints dynamically per action.
5. Validate with penalties for utility mismatches.
Refine inferred parameters with constraint-based optimization to satisfy all logs accurately.
Refine initial guess via optimization; enforce penalties for constraint violations.
