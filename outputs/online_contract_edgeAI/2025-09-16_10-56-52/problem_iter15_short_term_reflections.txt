Optimize GMM with more components and init, refine thresholds from labels, increase iterations.
Optimize with constraints via SLSQP, enforce IR/IC strictly, refine initial guesses from clustering.
Improve clustering with rejected logs, refine cost initialization using both acceptance and rejection thresholds.
1. Refine clusters using density weighting.
2. Directly set costs from min accepted utility.
3. Adjust for IR/IC with minimal perturbations.
4. Validate all logs for consistency.
Infer pairwise action constraints from logs; use sample weighting and refine optimization thresholds.
Refine costs via optimization to enforce IR/IC constraints strictly.
Infer actions from GMM clustering; initialize costs via utility thresholds from logs.
Prioritize IR/IC constraints with weights, refine cost initialization, and filter valid actions post-optimization.
Use tighter tolerance, simpler bounds, and refined cost initialization.
Refine thresholds using tighter bounds; penalize constraint violations heavily in optimization.
