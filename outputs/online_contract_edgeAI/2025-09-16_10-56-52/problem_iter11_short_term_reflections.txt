Refine initial clustering, use more precise constraints, and ensure better optimization setup.
Use clustering, refine cost bounds, and ensure constraint satisfaction with direct optimization.
Prioritize accurate clustering via GMM with more components, optimize with stronger feasibility constraints, and refine cost bounds carefully.
Use smarter clustering initialization, tighter constraints, and enhanced optimization tolerances for precision.
Use optimization to refine action probabilities and costs, ensuring consistency with all logs.
Use adaptive clustering on accepted contracts; refine cost bounds from rejected logs.
Focus on robust clustering validation, correct utility constraint setup, and refined cost bounds.
Optimize over probabilities and costs jointly; enforce constraints strictly with penalty terms.
Use more initial candidates, refine constraints, and extend optimization iterations for accuracy.
Use density-weighted clustering and enforce stricter cost constraints via rejection logs.
