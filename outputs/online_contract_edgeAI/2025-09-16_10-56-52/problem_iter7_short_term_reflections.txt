Try fewer GMM components, ensure action-centers normalization, and exclude redundant IC cost checks.
Use kernel smoothing for probabilities; refine cost constraints with accepted/rejected contract utilities.
Use action clustering, refine costs with rejection logs, and ensure IR/IC with tight bounds.
1. Optimize GMM via BIC.
2. Use assignment for cost bounds.
3. Enforce IC/IR from logs.
Use cluster assignments for action selection, ensure exact IC and IR via min/max utility constraints, avoid unnecessary smoothing.
Use optimization to refine action probabilities and costs, ensuring IC and IR constraints are strictly met with minimal squared error.
Use smoothed action centers and tighter cost inference from historical constraints.
1. Use IR/IC constraints to infer feasible costs.
2. Clustering explains multiple agent actions.
3. Adjust costs to ensure rejected logs are unprofitable.
4. Increase n_init and max_iter for better clustering.
5. Smooth probability distributions after clustering.
Use Bayesian Information Criterion to choose component count. Enforce IC via max utility from other actions.
Use tighter IR bounds from rejections; cluster actions using GMM with bounded components.
