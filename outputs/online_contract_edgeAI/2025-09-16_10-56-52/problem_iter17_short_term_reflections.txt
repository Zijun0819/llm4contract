Incorporate rejected logs in GMM weighting and use tighter tolerance for convergence.
Tighten tolerance, adjust cost initialization using thresholds, and fine-tune penalty weights.
Use clustering density weighting, adaptive cost tuning, and ensure strict feasibility in constraints.
Refine clustering with adaptive bandwidth; enforce stricter cost bounds via cross-validation.
Use tighter convergence tolerances and smarter initial cost estimates.
Refine cost initialization using both acceptance and rejection thresholds; adjust penalty weights carefully.
Refine cost estimation with density-weighted clustering; ensure cross-validation of IR/IC constraints.
Optimize clustering, refine cost bounds, and enforce constraints with penalty-based optimization.
Tighter tolerance, refined penalty weights, smarter cost initialization.
Weigh rejected logs in GMM; refine tolerances and penalty weights.
