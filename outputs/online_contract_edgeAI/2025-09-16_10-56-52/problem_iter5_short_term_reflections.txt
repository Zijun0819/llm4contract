Use clustering to generalize actions and enforce IR/IC via min costs and max rejection utilities.
Refine action clustering; optimize probabilities to fit both acceptance and rejection logs.
Consider minimum cost via accepted contracts and rejection constraints for tighter IR bounds.
Use probabilistic clustering and density estimation to refine action centers and ensure consistency with all logs.
Use GMM over KMeans for probabilistic clustering, and refine cost constraints using both accepted and rejected contracts.
Assign agent actions by clustering, then compute costs from accepted and rejected contracts directly.
Use GMM for clustering; optimize costs from IR and IC constraints.
Use BIC for optimal GMM component selection; assign actions via max utility matching; combine IR and rejection costs conservatively.
Try clustering actions and smoothing distributions for better generalization.
Use BIC for cluster count; smooth distributions; ensure costs respect both accept and reject constraints.
