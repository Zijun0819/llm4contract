Use weighted clustering, refined initial costs, and simpler penalty functions.
Refine candidate probabilities from accepted logs; use weighted GMM centers; enforce IR/IC with stricter tolerances.
Ensure precise probability normalization; include cost non-negativity in penalty to boost accuracy.
Refine costs with tighter IR enforcement; use stricter tolerance settings.
Incorporate more precise penalty terms and optimize GMM initialization with rejected logs.
Consider sample weights, refine costs from rejection logs, and increase tolerance for stability.
Use tighter tolerances, refine cost initialization, and add cost constraint.
Use adaptive clustering, refined cost initialization, and balanced penalties for better inference.
Refine initial cost estimates using rejection logs to tighten constraints.
GMM with weighted samples and refined cost thresholds improves fit.
