Use linear programming to infer actions from accepted logs, enforce IC/IR via penalty adjustments.
Use linear programming for exact distribution inference, cluster with fixed n_actions, and ensure IR/IC via explicit cost adjustment over clusters.
1. Use rejection logs to tighten cost bounds.
2. Ensure feasibility for all historical contracts.
3. Smooth probability distributions via KDE.
4. Set costs above maximum rejected utility per action.
Use linear programming for accurate probability bounds, enforce IC/IR via tight cost constraints, and cluster with KMeans for stable centroids.
Use GMM over KMeans, refine cost with max over reject utilities, incorporate all logs.
Use clustering with refinement, enforce constraints via optimization, and ensure rejection logs inform cost bounds.
Use adaptive clustering, validate IR/IC constraints strictly, and refine cost estimation from both accepted and rejected contracts.
Use clustering with flexible components, optimize constraints precisely, and enforce cost lower bounds from rejections.
1. Cluster by likelihood and rejection signals.
2. Calibrate costs using both accepted and rejected logs.
3. Set costs to enforce IC and IR constraints strictly.
4. Use optimization for accurate probability inference.
Use GMM clustering, refine via optimization with penalties for violations.
