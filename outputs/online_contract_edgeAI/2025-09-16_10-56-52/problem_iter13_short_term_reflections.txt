Weight action centers by density; refine costs to ensure strict IC/IR from logs.
Refine cost bounds using both accepted and rejected contracts; optimize with tighter constraints.
Refine GMM initialization, tighten optimization tolerances, enforce non-negative probabilities.
Refine initial cost estimates using stricter feasibility bounds. Use longer optimization with tighter tolerances.
Refine clustering; ensure costs strictly separate accepted/rejected utility bounds.
Use optimization with robust constraints and refine clustering to satisfy IR and IC conditions precisely.
Prioritize IR/IC with weighted penalties, optimize convergence, and validate action feasibility.
Refine cost bounds using kernel density weighting and ensure strict utility inequalities for rejection logs.
Weight rejected logs in GMM; increase IR/IC penalty; refine optimization parameters.
Use optimization with constraints and penalties to enforce IR and IC conditions tightly.
