Better `mini_lp_p` constraints, `k-means++` initialization, and cost adjustment improve agent setting inference.

Consider objective function sign in `minimize`, and K-means `n_init` parameter for stability.

Consider principal's reward in `mini_lp_p` and objective function. Use `k-means++` initialization and `max(0, min(costs))` for `c_init`.

1. `mini_lp_p`: Correct objective and constraints.
2. `rejected_contracts`: Maximize agent's utility.
3. `KMeans`: Increase `n_init`.
4. `c_init`: Tighter cost initialization.
5. Enforce IR constraints strictly.

Optimize `mini_lp_p` objective, K-means `n_init`, and cost initialization; ensure non-negative costs and utility consistency.

1. Correct `mini_lp_p` objective and constraints.
2. Optimize rejected contract utility maximization.
3. Improve K-means `n_init` and cost initialization.

1. **LP Formulation:** Adjust LP objective/constraints for tighter bounds.
2. **Objective Direction:** Maximize utility for rejected contracts.
3. **K-means:** Increase `n_init` and refine cost initialization/correction.

1. Correct the LP constraint sign.
2. Use 'k-means++' for KMeans initialization.

Optimize `mini_lp_p` objective, refine rejected contract handling, and tighten cost initialization using accepted contracts.

Consider cost function sign in `mini_lp_p` and objective function in minimization. Increase `n_init` for KMeans.
