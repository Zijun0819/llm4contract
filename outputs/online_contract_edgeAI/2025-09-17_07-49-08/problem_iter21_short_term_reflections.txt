Refine `mini_lp_p` constraint, objective for rejections, K-means initialization, and cost estimation with a final adjustment.

1. Correct LP formulation: `-v + w` and `-u`.
2. Use `k-means++` initialization for better clustering.
3. Enforce IR constraint with a post-processing step.

Refine `mini_lp_p` with agent's IR constraint. Use `-` in `objective` for rejected contracts. Initialize KMeans better, ensure non-negative costs, and enforce IR.

Minimize `n_candidates`, correct the rejected contract objective, and ensure non-negative costs using `np.maximum`.

Refine `mini_lp_p` with `-v + w` and `-utility`. Ensure non-negative costs using `min(max(0, c), costs)`. Adapt `n_candidates`.

Consider `k-means++` initialization, and use `np.max([0,np.min(costs)])` for cost initialization to better satisfy IR constraints.

1. Correct the LP constraint in `mini_lp_p`.
2. Use k-means++ initialization.
3. Refine cost estimation based on accepted contracts.

Refine `mini_lp_p` with utility constraints. Maximize expected utility for rejected contracts. Average accepted utilities for cost initialization.

Minimize agent utility in rejection, refine K-means, and ensure the cost aligns with accepted contracts' utility.

Refine `mini_lp_p` constraint, objective for rejected contracts, and cost initialization for tighter IR/IC.
