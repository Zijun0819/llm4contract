LP-based p inference, GMM clustering, and cost refinement with IR/IC constraints improve agent setting inference.

LP-based action inference, adaptive k-means, and cost refinement using rejections improve agent setting inference.

Fewer clusters, simpler cost initialization, and strict consistency checks improve agent setting inference.

Refine `mini_lp_p` objective, K-means initialization, and cost estimation using cluster proximity for better agent settings.

LP-based action inference, cost refinement using rejections, and adaptive k-means clustering improve agent setting inference.

Leverage rejection data to refine cost estimation. Ensure non-negativity of costs and handle empty clusters gracefully.

Use k-means for clustering, solve LP with principal utility, and refine costs based on acceptance.

GMM clustering, utility-based cost refinement, and considering rejections improve agent setting inference.

The better code uses principal utility in LP, focuses on accepted contracts, and estimates agent costs more precisely.

Utilize principal utility to guide agent type discovery. Incorporate linear programming for precise probability estimation.
