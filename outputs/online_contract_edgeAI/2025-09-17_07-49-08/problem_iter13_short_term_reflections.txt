Leverage principal utility in accepted contracts. Increase `n_candidates`. Ensure cost aligns with *both* acceptance and rejection.

Consider rejected contracts in `candidate_ps` generation and refine cost initialization using accepted contracts' utilities.

Consider principal utility in `mini_lp_p`, increase `n_candidates`, and refine cost estimation using accepted contracts' utilities.

Consider principal's reward in `mini_lp_p`, adjust `n_candidates`, and use accepted contracts to determine costs.

Better `mini_lp_p`: considers relative utility. `c_init`: ensures IR for accepted, and non-acceptance for rejected contracts.

Incorporate principal utility in `mini_lp_p`. Estimate costs more accurately using accepted contracts' utilities.

Incorporate principal utility in accepted contract constraints. Refine cost initialization using accepted contracts' utilities.

Consider rejected contracts for p candidates. Adjust `n_candidates`, and refine cost estimation using accepted contracts' utilities.

Increase `n_candidates`, refine `mini_lp_p`, incorporate rejected contracts, and improve cost initialization.

Refine `mini_lp_p` constraint, objective for rejected contracts, K-means algorithm, and cost initialization for better agent settings.
