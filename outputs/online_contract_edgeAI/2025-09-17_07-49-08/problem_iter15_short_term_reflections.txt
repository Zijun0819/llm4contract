Incorporate principal utility in `mini_lp_p`, increase `n_candidates`, refine cost initialization using accepted/rejected contracts.

Refine `mini_lp_p` with utility constraint. Adjust `n_candidates` based on data size. Improve cost initialization using both accepted and rejected contracts.

Increase `n_candidates`, use `k-means++` initialization, and constrain cost estimation to be non-positive.

Leverage principal utility in `mini_lp_p`. Increase `n_candidates`. Use `min` of accepted contract utilities for cost.

Use principal's utility in `mini_lp_p`. Consider agent's utility `w-v` for cost initialization. Increase `n_candidates`.

Minimize agent utility for rejections. Refine cost estimation using both accepted and rejected contracts. Increase K-means `n_init`.

Use `mini_lp_p` for accepted contracts; average expected utility for cost initialization.

Here's a breakdown of the key improvements and hints:

*   **`mini_lp_p` Constraint:** The better code adds `v - w` constraint to `mini_lp_p`. This directly incorporates principal's utility into agent's action inference.

*   **Cost initialization:** The better code initializes `c_init` by considering both rejected and accepted contracts, leading to a more robust cost estimation.

Use `linprog` for accepted contracts. Consider `v-w` when calculating costs. Increase `n_candidates` and `n_init`.

Refine `mini_lp_p` with principal's utility constraint. Optimize rejection sampling. Adjust `n_candidates` and K-means algorithm.
