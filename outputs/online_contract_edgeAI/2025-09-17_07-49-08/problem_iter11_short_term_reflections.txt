Maximize `n_candidates`, correct the rejected contract objective, increase `n_init`, and ensure non-negative costs.

Consider agent's utility from accepted contracts when setting costs. Reduce `n_candidates` for efficiency.

1. **Objective function:** Minimize agent's utility for rejected contracts.
2. **Cost initialization:** Use minimum utility from accepted contracts.
3. **K-means:** Increase `n_init` for better clustering.

Incorporate principal utility into `mini_lp_p`, minimize utility for rejected contracts, and refine cost estimation.

Consider rejected contracts in candidate generation and refine cost initialization using accepted contracts.

The better code adds a constraint in `mini_lp_p` and refines cost initialization using `min(costs)`. Also, n_init in Kmeans is increased.

Consider principal's utility in `mini_lp_p`. Maximize utility for rejected contracts to refine costs.

Consider principal's utility in `mini_lp_p`. Initialize costs based on *rejected* contracts' utilities. Reduce `n_candidates`.

1. Minimize `-expected_utility` for rejected contracts.
2. `n_candidates` tuning.
3. `KMeans` tuning: `n_init`, `algorithm`.
4. Cost initialization: consider accepted contracts' utilities.

Consider rejected contracts in cost estimation, refine utility estimation, and increase K-means `n_init`.
