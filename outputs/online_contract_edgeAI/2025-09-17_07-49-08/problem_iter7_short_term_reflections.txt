Leverage principal utility in LP. Optimize costs based on accepted contracts, not rejected ones. Increase `n_candidates`.

Minimize cost estimation loss; increase `n_candidates`; consider more sophisticated cost constraints during optimization.

Leverage principal's utility in LP, optimize rejected contracts' utility, and refine cost initialization.

Consider agent utility in `mini_lp_p`, use KMeans, and optimize costs with constraints.

Fewer candidate actions, and cost initialization focusing on rejected contracts, improve agent setting inference.

Consider rejected contracts in cost estimation. Increase `n_candidates`, and use K-means for clustering.

Consider rejected contracts, refine cost initialization with optimization, and increase `n_candidates`.

Minimize utility for accepted contracts, maximize utility for rejected contracts when inferring agent beliefs.

Leverage principal utility in LP, explore diverse initializations, and refine cost estimation using accepted contracts.

Fewer candidates, refined K-means, direct cost optimization from accepted contracts, and consistency checks improve inference.
