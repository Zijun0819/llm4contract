Refine `mini_lp_p`, objective function, K-means, and cost initialization. Enforce IR constraint post-processing.

Refine `mini_lp_p`'s constraints, objective for rejected contracts, and cost initialization for better agent setting inference.

Maximize rejected contract disutility. Increase `n_candidates`, `n_init`. Enforce IR constraints post-clustering. Use a fixed `random_state`.

Reduce `KMeans` `n_init` to improve speed without sacrificing much performance. Consider more sophisticated clustering methods.

Consider objective function sign in `minimize`, and K-means `n_init` parameter for stability.

Fewer `kmeans` initializations and more diverse candidate probabilities improve agent setting inference.

Maximize rejected contract utility, refine cost estimation using accepted contracts, and ensure IR constraint satisfaction.

Consider principal's reward in `mini_lp_p`, minimize utility for rejected contracts, refine K-means, and enforce IR better.

Maximize utility difference (v-w) for rejected contracts. Refine cost initialization and ensure IR constraint satisfaction.

Maximize rejected contract utility, correct `mini_lp_p` sign, refine cost estimation, and ensure IR constraint satisfaction.
