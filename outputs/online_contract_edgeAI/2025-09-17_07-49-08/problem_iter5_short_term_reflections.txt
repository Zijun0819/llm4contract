Hints:

1.  Solve for p directly using LP.
2.  Consider principal utility in finding p.
3.  Improve cost initialization.

LP-based p inference, consider rejected contracts in cost estimation, and increase `n_candidates`.

Consider principal utility in `mini_lp_p`. Refine cost estimation using accepted contracts' utilities. Reduce `n_candidates`.

Focus on efficient LP solving, incorporating principal utility, and refining cost initialization using both accepted and rejected contracts.

Better hints:
1. Use `SLSQP` for probability simplex constraints.
2. Normalize probabilities.
3. Adapt `n_candidates` to data size.
4. Directly minimize utility for accepted contracts.

Use K-means for clustering, check strict consistency, and handle edge cases with a default setting.

Use GMM instead of K-means, initialize costs better, and consider more candidate distributions.

LP solves for optimal beliefs. Clustering refines beliefs. Costs reflect rejection behavior, ensuring IR.

Focus on utility-tied distribution generation, K-means initialization, and cost calibration against both accept/reject actions.

Prioritize accepted contract data. Initialize costs more carefully using both accepted and rejected contracts. Increase `n_candidates`.
