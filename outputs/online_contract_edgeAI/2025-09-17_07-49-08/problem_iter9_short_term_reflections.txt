Focus on cost initialization. Maximize cost based on rejected contracts' expected utility. Reduce `n_candidates`.

Consider principal's utility in `mini_lp_p`, optimize `p` for rejected contracts, and refine cost initialization.

Increase `n_candidates`, refine `objective` for rejections, and use `min` instead of `max` in cost initialization.

Leverage linear programming for efficiency. Explicitly model accepted contracts in cost estimation.

Consider rejected contracts when generating candidate probabilities. Increase `n_candidates` and refine cost initialization.

Consider principal's reward in `mini_lp_p`, minimize EU for rejected contracts, and use accepted contracts to determine costs.

Minimize agent's expected utility in `mini_lp_p`. Refine cost initialization using rejected contracts' information.

Consider agent's IR constraint in `mini_lp_p`, increase `n_init` in KMeans, and ensure non-negative costs.

Increase `n_candidates`, maximize utility for rejected contracts, and increase `n_init` in KMeans.

The better code uses `min(n_candidates, len(all_p))` in KMeans, allowing more clusters and better fitting data.
