Use more clusters, optimize cost assignment, and refine probability normalization.
Improve clustering stability. Refine and deduplicate agent actions consistently.
Refine cluster centers with GMM after KMeans; ensure costs respect rejections with tight epsilon margins.
1. Use clustering diversity with both KMeans and GMM.
2. Merge and refine unique centroids for better generalization.
3. Enforce tight cost bounds from acceptance and rejection logs.
Improve clustering parameters, enforce tighter IC constraints, and merge similar actions to enhance utility and compliance.
Use Gaussian Mixture for clustering and carefully refine costs with acceptance and rejection constraints.
Use refined clustering with GMM for distributions and ensure cost updates respect both accepted and rejected contracts.
Use refined clustering with both KMeans and GMM to improve action differentiation and cost estimation.
Focus on robust clustering and precise IC/IR enforcement; avoid over-adjustment of costs.
Use clustering after Gaussian Mixture for refined costs; enforce stricter IC/IR with epsilon adjustments.
