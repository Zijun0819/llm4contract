Use stricter IR enforcement via positive slack and adaptive clustering for robustness.
Use more clusters; refine cost estimation via max-rejected utilities; ensure strict IR/IC with tighter bounds.
Assign costs using min utility from cluster members; increase cluster count for precision.
Clustering update: Use fixed n_clusters = min(50, len(all_p)) for consistency.
Use KMeans for faster clustering; adjust cost bounds strictly from accepted logs.
Use clustering to capture multiple actions, and ensure costs align with both accepted and rejected logs for IC and IR.
Incorporate rejection logs in cost updates, avoid under-estimation through max utilities.
Use more clusters, and ensure cost lower bounds from accepted contracts are tight.
Use more clusters; avoid floor division in n_clusters calculation.
Refine outcome estimates via GMM; rejections inform cost adjustments directly.
