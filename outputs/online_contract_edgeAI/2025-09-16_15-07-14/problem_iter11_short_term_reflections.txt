Try smaller clusters, refine cost bounds, and ensure strict inequality for IR/IC.
Use more clusters, refine probability constraints, and adjust cost offsets for tighter IR/IC compliance.
Use GMM after KMeans to refine cluster centers, ensuring better fit and utility constraints.
Use more precise clustering and cost adjustments to satisfy both acceptance and rejection constraints.
Refine clustering to capture true agent types; use tighter cost bounds for rejected contracts.
Increase clustering granularity, refine cost bounds via tighter IC checks.
Regularize cluster centers; use adaptive clustering; refine cost bounds for IR/IC.
Use tighter numerical tolerances; ensure cost bounds are properly enforced after cluster assignment.
Use Gaussian Mixture for soft clustering, then refine centroids and enforce unique costs.
Use robust probability normalization and simplified cost inference.
