Ensure probability distributions are non-negative and normalized before clustering; refine tolerance and iterations for accuracy.
Use GMM clustering for finer action modeling and cost refinement.
Use both k-means and GMM clustering, merge results, and deduplicate to improve agent setting inference.
Refine clustering with GMM; adjust costs using min utilities and rejections.
Use GMM for robust clustering, enforce non-negativity, and deduplicate centers efficiently.
Refine clustering with GMM; merge similar actions; adjust costs tightly to IR/IC constraints.
Refine clustering with GMM; merge similar centers; use tighter cost bounds.
Refine costs to strictly satisfy incentives; merge similar actions; verify IC/IR post-clustering.
Use GMM for refined clustering and merge similar clusters to reduce redundancy.
Use GMM for clustering, refine costs via utility constraints, then merge similar actions.
