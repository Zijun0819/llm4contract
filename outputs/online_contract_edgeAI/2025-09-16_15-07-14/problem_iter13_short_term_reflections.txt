Focus on clustering accepted logs, then set costs to match minimal utilities and rejections.
Refine cost estimation with tighter IR bounds and more robust clustering for consistency.
Use fewer clusters, normalize probabilities strictly, and avoid redundant clustering steps.
Use GMM for clustering, refine costs with stricter IR checks, and merge similar clusters to reduce redundancy.
Tighten LP constraints, refine cluster center costs, and ensure numerical stability.
Increase cluster count, refine cost calculation precision, and adjust cluster constraints for better fit.
Combine K-means and GMM clustering, then align costs with both accepted and rejected logs.
Refine clustering, tighten tolerances, and adjust cost increments for IC/IR precision.
Normalize probabilities post-optimization; use tighter cost bounds and fewer but more stable clusters.
Increase cluster count and refine cost computation for stricter constraint compliance.
