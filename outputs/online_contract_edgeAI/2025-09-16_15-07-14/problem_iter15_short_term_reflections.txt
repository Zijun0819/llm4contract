1. Use GMM to refine action clusters.
2. Incorporate rejected logs for cost calibration.
3. Merge and deduplicate similar clusters.
4. Continuously validate IR and IC constraints.
Use fewer clusters, simplify cost calculation, and avoid redundant clustering steps for efficiency and accuracy.
Refine clustering, adjust tolerance, normalize centers, simplify cost computation.
Refine clusters carefully; enforce constraints strictly; simplify merging steps.
Refine clustering adaptively; enforce stricter feasibility in LP; adjust cost bounds precisely.
Sharpen LP precision, expand clustering range, tighten cost bounds.
Use multiple clustering methods, merge results, and enforce IC/IR constraints more tightly.
Use fewer clusters, ensure probabilities are normalized, and simplify cost estimation.
Use tighter tolerances and post-process clusters to ensure non-negative probabilities and normalized distributions.
Use tighter tolerances, validate constraints, adaptive clustering, and precise cost adjustments.
