Refine cost computation using cluster assignments, iterate to enforce IC/IR, and merge similar actions.
Use K-means for efficiency, then refine with Gaussian Mixture. Ensure proper normalization and cost clipping.
Use KMeans first, refine with GMM for clusters and cost calibration.
Refine clustering with GMM after KMeans; adjust costs carefully using strict epsilon thresholds.
Use KMeans for initial clustering, refine with GMM for accuracy, and deduplicate similar actions.
Use GMM clustering, ensure costs satisfy IR/IC via epsilon bounds, handle zero sums robustly.
Use clustering after LP to refine action distributions and costs.
Refine clustering: Use KMeans first, then GMM for better density estimation and cost bounds.
Use Gaussian mixture clustering with refined cost adjustment from min utility; ensure unique centers.
Refine clustering parameters; use Gaussian Mixture directly for smoother distributions.
