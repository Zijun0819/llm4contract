Refine clustering dynamically; check IR/IC via rejection logs thoroughly; ensure unique, minimal costs.
Use GMM clustering; prioritize cost setting from cluster utilities; deduplicate with tolerance.
Infer distributions more accurately and use GMM for clustering; adjust costs from both accepted and rejected logs.
Use GMM clustering directly; merge constraints from accepted and rejected logs.
Use unique clustering and Gaussian Mixture on centers only to reduce redundancy and improve cost estimation.
Refine costs after clustering, use unique centers, and adjust with rejected logs.
Use more unique actions, refine cost estimation via clustering, and ensure consistent IR and IC checks.
Refine clustering; ensure stricter cost bounds from rejected logs; use GMM for better density estimation.
Use cluster probabilities for cost estimation; ensure unique actions only.
Focus on GMM with BIC selection for better clustering and cost estimation.
