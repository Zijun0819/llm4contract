Refine costs by minimizing violations, add actions dynamically, and adjust for rejections iteratively.
Use clustering on inferred beliefs, set costs from min accepted payoff per cluster, enforcing IC and IR via max over rejected contracts.
Refine cost bounds using KDTree for rejected contracts, enforce IR/IC via utility adjustments.
Use GMM clustering over KMeans, handle costs by minimizing accepted wages, and refine rejection constraints.
Use LP for feasibility, cluster similar actions, and adjust costs using rejection logs.
Use linear programming for efficiency; cluster with GMM; ensure costs reflect both acceptance and rejection constraints.
Clustering enhances stability; ensure robust LP solutions and accurate cost bounds for rejection logs.
Refine clustering with rejection logs, use min over linear constraints, and directly estimate costs from data.
Use GMM for clustering, infer costs from min utilities, refine with IC/IR via optimization.
Use more clusters, refine cost estimates with accepted data, ensure costs are non-negative.
