Use deterministic clustering and adjust costs strictly to enforce rejection constraints.
Use linear programming to infer beliefs directly from utility constraints.
1. Use LP to derive agent actions from principal utility.
2. Cluster inferred actions to reduce dimensionality.
3. Set costs based on minimum utility per cluster.
4. Adjust costs using rejection logs if available.
Use KMeans over GMM for clustering; vectorize rejected utility checks for efficiency.
Use GMM for clustering, adjust costs with margin to enforce IR constraints strictly, and refine actions via LP for IC.
Use KMeans for clustering, ensuring minimal utility for IR and IC via max constraints on rejected logs.
Focus on maximizing agent action costs from accepted contracts to strengthen IR and IC constraints.
Use clustering for precise action grouping and ensure cost updates respect rejection utilities.
Use more clusters, ensure stricter IR from rejections, and avoid GMM for faster, more robust clustering.
Use linear programming for efficiency and accuracy; cluster actions wisely; ensure costs satisfy all logs' constraints.
