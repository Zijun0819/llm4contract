Use clustering to identify diverse agent strategies; set costs based on minimal accepted utility without exceeding rejection thresholds.
Use KMeans clustering and ensure cost thresholds respect both acceptance and rejection conditions.
Use more clusters, refine cost bounds, and ensure tighter IR/IC constraints.
Use more clusters with KMeans; calibrate costs from cluster-specific contract utilities.
Use KMeans for clustering, handle rejections with max utilities, and enforce positivity constraints strictly.
Refine clustering with GMM, ensure tighter cost bounds, and merge unique centers for precision.
Refine cluster-based cost estimation using within-cluster min utility and stricter rejection constraints.
Adjust cost estimates with tighter margins; use cautious epsilon subtraction and addition.
Cluster more flexibly; ensure costs meet rejection constraints by using max utilities from rejected contracts.
Refine clustering granularity; adjust cost bounds using per-cluster utility minima and rejection data.
