Use refined clustering and unique action pruning to enhance robustness and utility.
Refine action clusters using GMM only, skip KMeans and merging steps for efficiency.
Use more clusters, filter duplicates, and refine costs with tighter IR/IC constraints.
Use clustering after LP, refine costs strictly, deduplicate similar actions.
Focus on fewer, more distinct clusters and streamline cost inference from utilities.
Combine clustering with cost refinement and enforce uniqueness via deduplication.
Use GMM clustering after KMeans, refine costs using both accepted and rejected logs.
Refine clustering with GMM post-KMeans to capture nuanced action distributions better.
Refine clustering with multiple GMM initializations for consistent cost estimates.
Use automatic n_init, ensure normalized probabilities, and merge cluster models uniquely.
